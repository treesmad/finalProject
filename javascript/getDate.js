//exploring retrieving and processing the date in angular; probably better to vanilla js it at this point


//in controller
//$scope.getDatetime = new Date();

//would display date thus
//<b>{{getDatetime | date:'yyyy-MMM-dd'}}</b>

//get current date, pass into service

//var currentDate = new Date();
//var day = ?* start/date of event *?
